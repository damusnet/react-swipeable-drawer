## The problem
 
Every time I see a hamburger menu and a drawer, I try to swipe it open.
 
## This solution
 
A tiny react library, with no dependencies, that relies mostly on css transforms.

![demo](./other/demo.gif)

 
## Installation
 
This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:
 
```
npm install --save react-swipeable-drawer
```
 
> This package also depends on `react` and `prop-types`. Please make sure you have
> those installed as well.
 
## Usage

See the complete [example](./examples).
 
Wrap your `MainContent` component in the `Drawer` component:

```jsx
import Drawer from "react-swipeable-drawer";

import DrawerContent from "./DrawerContent";
import MainContent from "./MainContent";

const App = () => (
  <Drawer width={80} content={<DrawerContent />}>
    <MainContent />
  </Drawer>
);

export default App;
```

In your `MainContent` component, use the `style` and `toggleDrawer` props:

```jsx
const MainContent = ({ style, toggleDrawer }) => (
  // It is very important to apply the style prop to your content,
  // otherwise it will still be able to scroll when the drawer is open
  <div className="App" style={{ ...style }}>
    You main content goes here...
    <button onClick={toggleDrawer}>Toggle Drawer</button>
  </div>
)

export default MainContent;
```

### Props

  - `width` (integer): width in percent (%) of the drawer
  - `content` (component): a react component with the content of your drawer

## Known limitations

Due to the fact that Safari on iOS interprets a swipe from the left as a navigation to the previous page, you will not be able to swipe the drawer open. The `toggleDrawer` function should still work though.
